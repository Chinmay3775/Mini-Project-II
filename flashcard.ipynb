It consists of supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning techniques. Supervised learning requires labeled data, while unsupervised learning finds hidden patterns in unlabeled data. Reinforcement learning is used in robotics and game AI, where agents learn by receiving rewards or penalties. The field is rapidly evolving, with applications in healthcare, finance, and automation.\n",
