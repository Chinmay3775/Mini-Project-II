        "Passive attacks are in the nature of eavesdropping on, or monitoring of, transmissions.\n",
        "The goal of the opponent is to obtain information that is being transmitted. Two types\n",
        "of passive attacks are the release of message content and traffic analysis. The release\n",
        "of message contents is easily understood (Figure 1.2a).\n",
        "A telephone conversation, an electronic mail message, and a transferred file may\n",
        "contain sensitive or confidential information.\n",
        "A second type of passive attack, traffic analysis, is subtler (Figure 1.2b). Suppose that\n",
        "we had a way of masking the contents of messages or other information traffic so that\n",
        "opponents, even if they captured the message, could not extract the information from\n",
        "the message.\n",
        "Passive attacks are very difficult to detect because they do not involve any alteration\n",
        "of the data. Typically, the message traffic is sent and received in a normal fashion, and\n",
        "neither the sender nor receiver is aware that a third party has read the messages or\n",
        "observed the traffic pattern.\n",
        "Active Attacks\n",
        "Active attacks involve some modification of the data stream or the creation of a false\n",
        "stream and can be subdivided into four categories: masquerade, replay, modification\n",
        "of messages, and denial of service.\n",
        "A masquerade takes place when one entity pretends to be a different entity (Figure\n",
        "1.3a). A masquerade attack usually includes one of the other forms of active attack.\n",
        "For example, authentication sequences can be captured and replayed after a valid\n",
        "authentication sequence has taken place, thus enabling an authorized entity with few\n",
        "privileges to obtain extra privileges by impersonating an entity that has those\n",
        "privileges.\n",
        "Replay involves the passive capture of a data unit and its subsequent retransmission\n",
        "to produce an unauthorized effect (Figure 1.3b).\n",
        "Modification of messages simply means that some portion of a legitimate message is\n",
        "altered, or that messages are delayed or reordered, to produce an unauthorized effect\n",
        "(Figure 1.3c). For example, a message meaning “Allow John Smith to read confidential\n",
        "file accounts” is modified to mean “Allow Fred Brown to read confidential file\n",
        "accounts.”\n",
        "The denial of service prevents or inhibits the normal use or management of\n",
        "communications facilities (Figure 1.3d). This attack may have a specific target\n",
        "Active attacks present the opposite characteristics of passive attacks. Whereas passive\n",
